AlphaRedmond is recreation of AlphaGo Zero, which I made to better understand the algorithm and to hone my ML chops. It is named after AlphaGo Zero and Michael Redmond 9p, the only professional player to reach the top professional rank in Go and the famous commentator of the AlphaGo games against Lee Sedol, Kie Jie, and others.

I will also be using this program to test out some ideas I have for modifications to the original algorithm. These include searches which favor depth over breadth - in order to propagate signal faster from the end of the game - as well as training the network estimate the expected information gain per rollout from analyzing a position - which will inform the network on whether it should increase or decrease the time spent on that position relative to the average.
